# Instance video colorization

## Presentation

![INTRO](https://github.com/liuvince/mva-instance-colorization/blob/main/Figure/Figure.png)

* 1-InstColorization\_video.ipynb Use Instance-Aware colorization [1] on DAVIS Dataset [3].

* 2-InstColorization\_video\_prior.ipynb Use [2] to improve temporal consistency.

* 3-InstColorization\_video\_bboxshown.ipynb Study impact of the bounding boxes on temporal consistency.

* 4-Metrics-*.ipynb metrics to measure performance degradation.
